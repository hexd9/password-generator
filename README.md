Password Generator

## Description

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I developed this random password generator to ensure that all member data is secure. The password generator is designed to create passwords with up to 128 characters to meet complex security requirements.

During the development process, I learned important programming concepts, such as variables, loops, and conditional statements. I used these concepts to create an application that allows users to select from a range of password criteria, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. With this password generator, I can now ensure that all sensitive data is kept secure.

## Usage

To generate a secure password, simply click the "Generate Password" button and follow the prompts to select the desired password criteria. The application will then use a random number generator to create a password that meets the specified criteria.
